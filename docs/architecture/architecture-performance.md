# Kookie UI - Performance Architecture

## Performance Philosophy

Kookie UI is built with performance as a core principle. This document outlines the strategies and techniques used to ensure the library delivers exceptional performance without compromising on features or design.

## Key Performance Metrics

Kookie UI optimizes for these key metrics:

1. **Bundle Size**: Minimizing impact on application bundle size
2. **Render Performance**: Fast initial and update renders
3. **Animation Performance**: Smooth, efficient animations
4. **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint
5. **Time to Interactive**: Quick component availability

## CSS-First Approach

### Tailwind CSS Optimization

Kookie UI uses Tailwind CSS with optimizations for production:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors');

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    // Purge unused styles in production
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Theme extensions
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // Only include plugins you need
  ],
  // Safelist only critical classes that might be dynamically created
  safelist: [
    // Critical dynamic classes
  ],
}
```

### CSS vs. JavaScript Tradeoffs

1. **Prefer CSS for Animations**
   - Use CSS transitions and animations over JavaScript when possible
   - Use CSS custom properties for dynamic values
   - Use `will-change` property strategically

2. **Use Hardware Acceleration Selectively**
   - Apply `transform`, `opacity`, and `filter` for hardware acceleration
   - Avoid overusing `will-change` property
   - Use `translate3d` for hardware acceleration only when needed

3. **Minimize DOM Operations**
   - Use CSS for state changes instead of DOM manipulation
   - Batch DOM operations when JavaScript is necessary
   - Leverage CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout instead of JS calculations

## JavaScript Optimization

### Component Rendering Optimizations

1. **Memoization Strategy**
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Apply useCallback for event handlers passed to child components

```tsx
// Optimized Button component example
export const Button = React.memo(function Button({
  children,
  variant = 'solid',
  size = 'md',
  onClick,
  ...props
}: ButtonProps) {
  // Implementation with performance optimizations
  const handleClick = useCallback((e) => {
    // Custom logic
    onClick?.(e);
  }, [onClick]);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
});
```

2. **State Management with Jotai**
   - Leverage Jotai's atomic updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Split atoms strategically to minimize re-renders
   - Use derived atoms for computed values

```tsx
// Efficient state management with Jotai
import { atom, useAtom, useAtomValue } from 'jotai';

// Base atoms
export const colorAtom = atom('blue');
export const sizeAtom = atom('md');

// Derived atom - only updates when colorAtom changes
export const primaryColorClassAtom = atom(
  (get) => `bg-${get(colorAtom)}-500`
);

// Component using atom
function ColoredButton() {
  // Only re-renders when this specific value changes
  const primaryColorClass = useAtomValue(primaryColorClassAtom);
  
  return <button className={primaryColorClass}>Click me</button>;
}
```

### Bundle Size Optimization

1. **Tree Shaking Strategy**
   - Export individual components
   - Avoid barrel exports where possible
   - Mark packages as side-effect free

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "@kookie-ui/core",
  "sideEffects": false,
  "exports": {
    "./button": "./dist/button/index.js",
    "./card": "./dist/card/index.js",
    // Other component exports
  }
}
```

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Split complex components
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Separate core and advanced features

```tsx
// Dynamic import example
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

// Only load when needed
const ComplexDataTable = lazy(() => import('./complex-data-table'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ComplexDataTable />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## WebGL Performance with React Three Fiber

For complex visual effects like animated backgrounds, gradients, and particles, Kookie UI leverages React Three Fiber (r3f) - a React renderer for Three.js.

### R3F Integration Benefits

1. **Declarative WebGL**
   - Leverage React's component model for Three.js
   - Simplify scene management with hooks and components
   - Integrate WebGL seamlessly with the component lifecycle

2. **Optimized Rendering**
   - Automatic render batching
   - Scene graph optimization
   - Efficient use of GPU resources

3. **React-Based Scene Management**
   - Component-based scene hierarchy
   - Hooks for animation frames, raycasting, and physics
   - Easy integration with React state management

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Render Control**
   - Use `<Canvas invalidateFrameloop>` for static scenes
   - Implement custom frame loop control when needed
   - Disable rendering when component is not visible

2. **Asset Management**
   - Pre-load and cache geometries, textures, and materials
   - Use instancing for repeated elements
   - Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for complex scenes

3. **Selective Rendering**
   - Implement frustum culling
   - Use Suspense for dynamic loading
   - Reduce polycount for background elements

### Adaptive Performance

1. **Device Capability Detection**
   - Scale complexity based on device performance
   - Provide simpler fallbacks for low-end devices
   - Adjust pixel ratio dynamically

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with CSS-based effects
   - Enhance with basic WebGL for mid-tier devices
   - Provide full effects only for high-performance devices
```

## Animation and Visual Effects Strategy

### CSS Animations

For simple animations, CSS is preferred for optimal performance:

1. **Performance-Focused CSS Animations**
   - Animate only transform and opacity properties when possible
   - Use `will-change` property strategically
   - Implement staggered animations with CSS, not JS

### React Three Fiber for WebGL Effects

Advanced visual effects use React Three Fiber:

1. **Library Dependencies**
   - react-three-fiber as the core renderer
   - drei for helpful abstractions and optimizations
   - postprocessing for advanced visual effects
   - zustand for performant effect state management

2. **Integration Strategy**
   - Canvas components with proper cleanup
   - Shared resources between effects
   - Dynamic imports for code splitting
   - Feature detection for capability-based rendering

3. **Animation Loop Management**
   - Pause animations when not visible
   - Scale animation complexity based on FPS
   - Optimize animation loops with useFrame

### Component Architecture for Effects

Effect components follow a layered architecture:

1. **Base Layer** - Simple CSS-based effects for all devices
2. **Enhanced Layer** - Basic WebGL for mid-tier devices
3. **Advanced Layer** - Full r3f effects for high-end devices

This progressive enhancement ensures visual impact without sacrificing performance across the device spectrum.

## Responsive Performance

### Adaptive Loading

Kookie UI components adapt to device capabilities:

1. **Feature Detection**
   - Check browser support for advanced features
   - Provide fallbacks for unsupported features
   - Adapt animations based on device performance

```tsx
// Adaptive feature detection
function useDeviceCapabilities() {
  const [capabilities, setCapabilities] = useState({
    supportsWebGL: false,
    highPerformance: false,
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check WebGL support
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const supportsWebGL = !!(
      window.WebGLRenderingContext &&
      (canvas.getContext('webgl') || canvas.getContext('experimental-webgl'))
    );
    
    // Check device performance
    const highPerformance = !navigator.userAgent.includes('Mobile') && 
      window.navigator.hardwareConcurrency > 4;
    
    setCapabilities({
      supportsWebGL,
      highPerformance,
    });
  }, []);
  
  return capabilities;
}
```

2. **Responsive Media Loading**
   - Use responsive images with srcset
   - Lazy load images and media
   - Provide image placeholders

```tsx
// Optimized image component
function OptimizedImage({ src, alt, sizes = '100vw', ...props }) {
  return (
    <img
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      sizes={sizes}
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

## Performance Testing & Monitoring

### Performance Budgets

Kookie UI enforces strict performance budgets:

1. **Bundle Size Budgets**
   - Core components: < 5KB gzipped each
   - Total library: < 50KB gzipped for typical usage
   - Tree-shakeable to < 20KB for minimal usage

2. **Render Performance Budgets**
   - Initial render: < 50ms per component
   - Re-render: < 10ms per component
   - Animation: 60fps (16.6ms per frame)

### Automated Testing

Automated performance testing is integrated into the development workflow:

```js
// Performance test example
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

describe('Button Performance', () => {
  it('renders efficiently', async () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    
    // Render many times to get reliable measurement
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      const { unmount } = render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
      unmount();
    }
    
    const end = performance.now();
    const avgRenderTime = (end - start) / 100;
    
    expect(avgRenderTime).toBeLessThan(5); // Less than 5ms per render
  });
});
```

### Real-World Monitoring

1. **User-Centric Metrics**
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   - First Input Delay (FID)
   - Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

2. **Component-Level Monitoring**
   - Render times
   - Time to interactive
   - Memory usage
